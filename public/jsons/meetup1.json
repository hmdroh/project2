But choosing what’s<br/>valuable doesn’t come naturally. We’ve all had the experience of getting what we naturally want, only to discover it’s not what is most valuable—it’s not what we ultimately want. But how do we avoid being deceived by our short-term desires?</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Bottled water will be provided.

Each week we will watch a video based on the featured topic; in a community (both large group, and small) we will discuss a series of thoughtful questions to encourage insightful conversations. We hope our time together will lead to active changes and practical steps for growth for all interested in better relationships. You may wish to join amidst an existing series or at the beginning of our next one.</p> <p>OUR MISSION is to provide community and a place of solace to singles, whether single by chance, change, or choice.<br/>OUR HOPE is to encourage singles to embrace God’s love and unique plan for their lives.<br/>OUR DESIRE is to transform through growing in our relationship with God, and in friendship with each other.</p> <p>TO LEARN MORE:<br/>By visiting The Venture website: <a href=\"http://venture.cc/classes\" class=\"linkified\">http://venture.cc/classes</a> (bottom of page)<br/>By joining Facebook group: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/rightrelationships/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/rightrelationships/</a><br/>By emailing Mark Barber: [masked]</p> ",

The intent of the ride is to have fun! and to meet other women who love to mtn bike.</p> <p>Ladies, we are in for a treat! Kelli has graciously volunteered to help lead a ride at the Augustine Bernal and Pleasanton Ridge Parks, via the Golden Eagle entrance. This entrance starts at a higher elevation than the standard Pleasanton Ridge ride and starts us off on a trail which is mostly shaded. This means less climbing and much more shade than the standard route! Yay! The Golden Eagle entrance is in a gated residential area so it is awesome that Kelli can get us in! So, you must TELL THE GATE ATTENDANT that YOU ARE WITH KELLI's RIDE.</p> <p>The hills are brilliantly green right now and wildflowers are blooming meaning a beautiful scenic ride is in store. The route has an initial 1.9 mile climb, and is about 10 miles in length with 1600’ of climbing. It is about 75% singletrack – yay! Plan on a 2-3 hour ride. Though there is less climbing than the standard route, there still will be climbing, with a few semi-steep sections. This ride is best for riders who have some aerobic and climbing ability. The route is a little technical in places including a few switchbacks. This is not a novice ride but its not super advanced either. Afterwards we’ll hang out for refreshments and socializing. If you have questions on whether this ride is right for you, please email Amy at: [masked]</p> <p>What to bring: a mtn bike in good working condition, and water and snacks for the trail.</p> <p>When: Sat 5/5/2018. Meet at 9:15 am to sign in, unload bikes, and meet other riders. We will roll at 9:30.</p> <p>Carpool: If possible please carpool since parking may be somewhat limited.</p> <p>Where: The Golden Eagle entrance address is: 8200 Golden Eagle Way, Pleasanton.</p> <p>How to enter: AT THE GATE TELL THE ATTENDANT that YOU ARE WITH “KELLI'S RIDE”.</p> <p>Headcount: Please RSVP if you are quite certain you will attend, but cancel your RSVP by Friday 8 pm if you cannot make it. This way we can let the entrance attendant know how many riders to expect. If something comes up the morning of the ride please call Kelli at[masked].</p> <p>Rain cancels. If you RSVP on Meetup, you will receive an email by noon the day before the ride if the ride is cancelled or if there is any change to the ride.</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you!</p> <p>If you have questions, please Meetup-message Amy.</p> ",

We'll meet up at the lot and ride up from there towards maises peak. The initial climb can be challenging for newer riders but we'll have a sweep to make sure no one gets left behind. We'll all meetup at the top of Maises for a group photo before heading back towards the toyon trails. If we have faster riders that want extra credit, there will be an option to do all three toyon trails. The rest of us will head down toyon 2 and 1 before heading towards the beginning of seven springs trail.</p> <p>The total ride is about 7 miles and under 1000ft of elevation gain. If you are new to the sport and have any questions please feel free to message or email me. I'm always happy to help and offer any experience new riders.</p> <p>Get out, go ride!<br/>-David</p> ",

We'll then reply with instructions to complete your reservation.</p> <p>This event is published on multiple Meetups, so please don't let a seemingly low or no RSVP count mislead you in terms of the remaining available spots for this event.</p> <p>Thanks and we're looking forward to seeing you soon,<br/>Steve &amp; Lin</p> <p>Steve is a US Coast Guard Licensed Master.
